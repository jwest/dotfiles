#: If enabled, the window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

# fat -- One (or optionally more) windows are shown full width on the top, the rest of the windows are shown side-by-side on the bottom
# grid -- All windows are shown in a grid
# horizontal -- All windows are shown side-by-side
# splits -- Windows arranged in arbitrary patterns created using horizontal and vertical splits
# stack -- Only a single maximized window is shown at a time
# tall -- One (or optionally more) windows are shown full height on the left, the rest of the windows are shown one below the other on the right
# vertical -- All windows are shown one below the other

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts.

window_resize_step_cells 2
window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the keyboard
#: (start_resizing_window). The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing and the lines value for vertical resizing.

allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc.  Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. You can chose to either allow any program running
#: within kitty to control it, with yes or only programs that connect
#: to the socket specified with the kitty --listen-on command line
#: option, if you use the value socket-only. The latter is useful if
#: you want to prevent programs running on a remote computer over ssh
#: from controlling kitty. Reloading the config will not affect this
#: setting.

#listen_on unix:$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kitty.sock
#listen_on tcp:localhost:12488

#: Tell kitty to listen to the specified unix/tcp socket for remote
#: control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
#: instances. It can be overridden by the kitty --listen-on command
#: line flag. This option accepts only UNIX sockets, such as
#: unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or (on Linux) unix:@mykitty. Environment
#: variables are expanded. If {kitty_pid} is present then it is
#: replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the PID of the
#: kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen. This option
#: is ignored unless you also set allow_remote_control to enable
#: remote control. See the help for kitty --listen-on for more
#: details. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.


#startup_session none
#startup_session session.conf



allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink (OSC 8) escape sequences. If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click by with the mouse or the hints kitten
#: </kittens/hints>. The special value of ``ask`` means that kitty
#: will ask before opening the link when clicked.

shell_integration enabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells.  Set to
#: ``disabled`` to turn off shell integration, completely. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/ for details.
